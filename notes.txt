Use objects for the grids so i can store stuff like peices and have posisions



todo for project:

set postision in pieces in files
have diffrent build states
switch colours
numbers and letter grid reffrences
arrows for pieces
highleted for potential moves.
reset button



you could do the grid as 64 buttons or track mouse and use maths to find the postision.

i think buttons are easier but could be more anoying to deal with.

for files i think you should just type in the file name and it will add the .txt and get it that way from a text box else it will have a pop up.
